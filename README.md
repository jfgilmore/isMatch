# isMatch
Creating a function in JS to replicate isMatch from Lodash

# Why

We did this one in class at [Coder Academy](https://www.coderacademy.edu.au) and I felt it was incomplete, inputs could be passed as true even if a second key value pair resolved to false in some circumstances.

So I re-wrote the existing tests and added some others for better coverage. I then re-wrote my code to cover all of the potential test cases.
